# Iron_deprivation_carbon_sources_tuberculosis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code and data for a study on how iron deprivation influences transcriptional responses to growth arrest in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, focusing on different carbon sources. The study investigates changes in gene expression patterns as the carbon source transitions from Glycerol-Dextrose to Glycerol, Glycerol-Lipids, and finally to Lipids.
